# ðŸ‘¾ Space_Invaders ([Editor's Choice on simmer.io](https://sharemygame.com/@realYMYPlus/space-invaders))
Space Invaders is the first fixed shoot 'em up game in the world designed by Tomohiro Nishikado. It is the best-selling game of all arcade games. I migrated the classic/earliest [1978 version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MU4psw3ccUI) to PC via C# and Unity. I tried to mimic the original game as much as possible except for 2 small differences:
- I either don't understand how bunker destruction was implemented in the original version or I can't find assets of broken bunker parts online. Therefore, the bunker system in my version does not resemble the original version perfectly.
- In the 1970s, hardware is the bottleneck for games and there's really no concept of deltaTime. And that is the reason why in the 1978 version space invaders accelerate as their number decreases. However, I have decided to keep this feature as that makes the game reasonably more challenging and interesting.

Finally, [this](https://www.deviantart.com/gooperblooper22/art/Space-Invaders-Sprite-Sheet-135338373) is where I found all the assets.
